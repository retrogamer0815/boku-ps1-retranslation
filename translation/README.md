# translation/

The English, and everything a translator reads before writing it. Licence: CC BY-SA 4.0
(`LICENSE-translation`). The day files and their format are [days/README.md](days/README.md);
the three sample scenes the style rulings were read from, since folded into the day files, are
[samples/README.md](samples/README.md); the voice and
register are [style-guide.md](style-guide.md) and [bible.md](bible.md); names are
[glossary.md](glossary.md); open questions for Jay are [QUESTIONS.md](QUESTIONS.md); speech
with no text on the disc is [voice-only.md](voice-only.md); the words Jay chose for particular
lines, which no pass rewrites without him, are [locked.tsv](#lockedtsv).

To read the whole translation in order — every day's events, the day-independent events, the
menus and screens, the clips, the movie subtitles and every typeset texture beside its original —
run `./make.sh reader` and open `work/reader/index.html` (never tracked: it is the Japanese and the
game's pixels). `j`/`k` step through it, `c` copies the current item's id for a comment; the
lint's findings sit on the items they are about, and each section shows its unit's state from
[status.tsv](#statustsv). `./make.sh build-days` rewrites the page after every build. Its header
names the commit and the days build it was made from, and says so in red when that build lacks
what the page shows: a translation file saved after the build began, or code or translation
committed since the build's commit.

## Local human review pilot (this fork)

This fork is replacing inherited AI-written English through Japanese-fluent human review.
The upstream workflow and Jay's historical decisions remain documented below; their review
states do not establish human approval for this fork. The export starts every row as
`unreviewed` and changes no day file in place.

The first batch is now accepted: 13 translatable entries across E0171, E0184 and E0112,
11 with replacement wording, plus the unchanged context-only E0184.2 row. The reviewed
English is in `days/day01.txt`. All 19 dialogue pages passed Beetle inspection, and the
owner confirmed a successful DuckStation review on 2026-10-09. English-only
[human-review.tsv](human-review.tsv) records each reviewed id, its text SHA-256 and review
date. The hash covers the UTF-8 English field including ` // ` and ` | ` separators,
without the row's newline. A later wording change invalidates that recorded review until
it is reviewed again; export tools do not automatically restore approval from this table.

Two non-blocking linter flags remain for the reviewer: `really` in E0112.2 and E0112.4.
They have not been suppressed or used to rewrite the human wording. The obsolete upstream
E0112.2 VOICE annotation and E0171.1 translation note were updated for the accepted text.
The upstream phrase lock on E0171.1 was retired with its history preserved in a comment;
the owner's instruction to replace AI wording with the reviewed human text governs this
fork. The remaining upstream locks continue to apply until explicitly superseded.

With an imported/extracted disc and the renderer's `build/vwf/edits.json` available:

```sh
./make.sh review-pilot export --out work/human-review/export
./make.sh review-pilot import work/human-review/export --out work/human-review/noop
```

The default selection is three complete Day 1 events: E0171, E0184 and E0112 (14 rows,
including an empty voice-only row, multiple pages and a choice). `--source FILE` and
`--events EVENT...` select other complete event blocks from one day file or `shared.txt`.
Both commands accept `--disc DIR` and `--cells FILE` for an existing baseline checkout.
Every output directory must be new and inside this checkout's ignored `work/`.

The export contains:

* `review.json`: stable line IDs, speaker, event grouping, order and turn positions,
  start/continue/end/single markers, inherited English, editable segments and review status.
  Edit only each segment's `translation` and the row's `review_status` (`unreviewed`,
  `draft`, `human-reviewed`, or `needs-revision`). A successful fit check never grants human
  approval. Page slots correspond to ` // `; select slots distinguish leading prompts
  from answers and retain their order. Empty voice-only rows remain empty in this pilot.
* `manifest.json` and `source.txt`: the immutable export description and exact source bytes.
  Imports refuse a changed source or manifest, missing/duplicate IDs, changed metadata or
  page/choice slots. Sorting review rows does not reorder the script.
* `context.json`: complete selected scene graphs, conditions, occurrences, original page
  timing and source lines from the local extraction. This is original-game data: keep it
  local and ignored; never commit or upload it. The full English file and comments are in
  `source.txt`. Turn/boundary markers describe an event's message list; branches and repeat
  visits are governed by the scene graph, not a guaranteed linear conversation.
* `fit.json`: actual wrapped lines, measured pixel widths and line limits from
  `boku.build.lay_out`, using the supplied renderer edit set. The complete candidate file
  is also checked by the existing translation linter. Text, edit-set and Python-code hashes
  identify the result. Each import measures again; exported fit results are never trusted.

After editing `review.json`, import into another fresh directory. `--review FILE` can use
an edited copy while retaining the export. A successful import stages the complete `.txt`
file plus the edited review and fit report. It preserves all unchanged bytes, including
comments and line endings; a no-op must be byte-identical. A validation failure writes a
report but no candidate translation file. The tracked translation remains untouched.

Check a staged result with the upstream tools before applying any human-approved wording:

```sh
./make.sh lint-translation work/human-review/edited/day01.txt
./make.sh mockup work/human-review/edited/day01.txt --events E0171 E0184 E0112 \
  --out work/human-review/mockup
```

Pass the same baseline import to `--disc`, and the same font edit set to the linter's
`--cells` and mockup's `--edits`, when using nondefault paths. Mockups contain game glyph
pixels and stay local under `work/` too. These tools remain the final authority on fit;
pixel sums in a future spreadsheet must not implement different wrapping rules.

The JSON pilot is the underlying contract. The preview and workbook workflow below uses it.
Cross-file/shared occurrence management, changing page structure or speaker labels, and new
voice subtitles are later steps. Arrays, movies and texture text are outside this pilot.
No renderer, relocation, page-timing or translation-loader rules are changed.

### Exact preview and review workbook

`./make.sh review-preview` recomputes the fit through the same build and lint functions,
then draws the selected events through the upstream mockup generator. It produces a local
`index.html` with the Japanese source, full scene graphs and actual game-font mockups, plus
an English-only `workbook-data.json` for the review workbook. All outputs stay under `work/`.

```sh
./make.sh review-preview work/human-review/export --out work/human-review/preview
```

The workbook keeps the earlier review workflow's conversation grouping, play order, speaker,
turn position, boundary and human-review status. `Translation Batch` has one row per line
ID. `Human English` is editable; blank means retain `Upstream English`. Keep ` // ` page
breaks and ` | ` choice fields in their original positions. `Review notes` is a separate
editable field; notes stay in a sidecar rather than rewriting existing day-file comments.
`Page Preview` lists the exact wrapped lines and pixel widths for each page or choice field.
Use the companion local HTML for game-font pixels, not the workbook's display font.
The default workbook data remains English-only. With the owner's explicit authorization,
the review Sheet may include an `Original Japanese` reference column immediately after
`Speaker`, populated by line ID from the local script store. Preserve the source's page
and choice boundaries; label voice-only entries as having no written source. This reference
text must never enter tracked files. Game glyph images and other original assets stay local.

The initial offline workbook uses validated snapshots. Changing
the effective English makes the row say `NEEDS CHECK` and clears old counts, widths and page
previews. Matching uses case-sensitive `EXACT`, because capitalization can change glyph
widths. A changed layout profile also invalidates the cached results. Recompute after any
source, font or layout-code change; an offline workbook cannot detect changed local files.
`FITS` describes layout only. It never grants human translation approval.

The published Google Sheets pilot now has an automatic pixel preview. Enter translations
in column E (`Human English`); G (`Fit`), H:J and `Page Preview` recalculate on each edit.
No chat, local server, script authorization or manual button is needed. Column F remains
the human review decision. Preserve the literal ` // ` and ` | ` separators, including
their spaces. `OVERFLOW` means a page exceeds its width or three-line limit, or a choice
exceeds its single-line limit. Other messages identify unsupported characters, controls,
outer spaces, altered page/choice counts, voice-only text or changed immutable context.

`boku.review_sheet.profile(manifest, store, encoder, select_box)` extracts the renderer's
numeric character advances and original speaker/quotation wrappers.
`workbook_formulas(profile)` generates the hidden calculation matrices and the two visible
formula blocks for this 16-column pilot. These are preparation functions, with no network
writes. Keep generated profiles and readback evidence under ignored `work/`; publishing
the dump-derived measurements requires the owner's authorization. The current Sheet has
that authorization for its 99 character-width measurements, with no glyph images uploaded.

The formulas port `boku.layout.wrap`: numeric Unicode lookups preserve case-sensitive
widths, repeated spaces and conditional hyphen splitting. They include labels and quotation
marks, keep each original page slot, enforce 272/272/238 px dialogue limits, and measure
choices without wrapping at 248 px. `Validated layout` retains the earlier local snapshot;
the live preview uses `_Font metrics`, `_Live fit` and `_Live pages`. The hidden
`_Preview tests` tab contains comparison fixtures, not translation input.

Native Sheets verification covered 214 wrapping/width cases, 15 input checks and all 21
page/choice rows in the current batch against the actual repository layout functions.
Editing and restoring a pilot input also verified automatic overflow and unsupported-character
errors. Evidence is local in `work/human-translation-preview/live-sheet-r2/`.
Before changing the font, wrapping code or reviewed event selection, regenerate the profile
from the verified pilot manifest and current edit set, and repeat the native comparisons.
Sheets cannot detect local repository changes. Its display font is only a reading aid;
repository lint and game-font mockups remain the final authority before a build.

Download the entire `Translation Batch` tab as CSV after editing, then run:

```sh
./make.sh review-preview work/human-review/export --csv review.csv \
  --out work/human-review/checked
```

Pass the existing baseline's `--disc` and `--cells` paths when needed, as with the pilot.
The CSV reader verifies IDs and immutable context, preserves notes, rejects changed page or
choice counts, and ignores every imported fit formula/result. It writes a checked `review.json`
and new previews without modifying the translation source. Feed that JSON back to
`./make.sh review-pilot import ... --review ...` to stage an accepted candidate. A downloaded
subset or missing row is refused. Sorting the full tab is safe because imports use IDs.
The optional `Original Japanese` column is ignored on import; it cannot change the English,
review notes, or fit measurements. Refreshed `workbook-data.json` stays English-only, so
retain the authorized reference column when updating an existing Sheet.

The initial local workbook has been tested for recalculation, case-sensitive text changes,
layout-profile changes, CSV round trips and exact mockup reproduction. The live Sheets
preview does not write back to the repository; use the checked CSV import above. The older
workbook and experimental project remain reference material and are not modified.

## Translating the whole game

Jay, 2026-09-23: one translator session is given everything — the story bible, the style
guide, the glossary and the checklist, whole — and then the game one event at a time in play
order, so every line is written knowing all that came before it, and a revision pass can
follow with the whole game in view.

```
./make.sh packet --game          # writes work/packets/game/ (never tracked: it is the Japanese)
```

* `system.md` is the first message (or the system prompt): the day-file format, then the four
  documents whole. About 95,000 characters, ~29,000 tokens.
* `order.txt` has one row per part, in the order to give them: the event id or surface key,
  a tab, and the translation file its answer is saved into (`day08.txt`, `shared.txt`,
  `arrays.txt`, …). All 31 days, each day's events in its day file's order where one exists,
  each day-independent event on the day its id names (`E1006` on day 10) when its condition
  allows that day, else at the first day that can reach it (the examine texts, the bath, the
  dinner quiz: day 1); then the menus, books and screens. The first part of each day says "Day N begins".
* `<key>.md` is each part (`exe@code:…` is saved as `exe@code_….md`). Together about 470,000
  characters, ~186,000 tokens; the English answers add ~77,000 more (measured against days
  1–7; all figures 2026-09-23), so a whole-game session is ~300,000 tokens and needs a
  1M-context model.
* Not in it: `clips.txt` and `movies.txt`. Their source is a transcript of the audio under
  `work/voice/`, not the disc's text, and their rows are keyed by clip and frame, not by event.

The orchestrator (a script, or a parent agent that never translates) drives the session:

1. Send `system.md`. Then for each row `KEY<TAB>FILE` of `order.txt`, in order: send
   `KEY.md` as the next message, take the reply, and save it:
   `./make.sh save-event KEY --answer reply.txt --into translation/days/FILE --order work/packets/game/order.txt`.
   The reply is the fenced block; prose around it is ignored.
2. A refusal (an id missing or extra, Japanese left in a row or a note, a speaker that is not a
   style-guide label, a line that drops Jay's words from [locked.tsv](#lockedtsv)) leaves the
   file untouched and says why: send the message back and ask for the block again. Never
   edit an answer by hand to make it save.
3. At the end of each day, `./make.sh lint-translation` over the day's file; fit on screen is
   the lint's, not the translator's, so a page too long is not sent back.
4. After the last part, the revision pass: ask the session whether it wants to revise a day
   now that it has seen the whole game; for each part it revises, it answers with the whole
   block again and the same `save-event` command replaces the old one.

Every unit already holds reviewed English ([status.tsv](#statustsv)), and a new whole-game run
replaces each block as it reaches it: tag the tree first, as `TRN-10` did
(`pre-trn10-2026-09-23`), and compare.
Every answer still goes through the independent review against the Japanese
(`./make.sh packet --like FILE --for-review`) before it counts as reviewed. A finding against
words in [locked.tsv](#lockedtsv) is not applied: it goes to Jay.

## locked.tsv

This section records upstream policy. In this fork, the owner can accept a human revision
that supersedes an upstream wording lock. Record that decision beside the affected lock;
do not bypass the lock checker or change unrelated locks. Retired locks remain comments
so their provenance is preserved.

The words Jay chose for particular lines: what he wrote or dictated into a line, a name he
heard, a wording he picked from options put to him about that line (`work/review/decisions.html`).
They are not the policy — a style-guide or glossary ruling binds every line and lives in those
documents — but the words of one line, which a pass working from the Japanese cannot rediscover:
held only in a day file, they are replaced by the next pass that rewrites the line. A wording
accepted "as built", with no choice of words, is not a lock.

```
id <TAB> match <TAB> words <TAB> source
E0175.0	phrase	This is the Sorano house, and I'm your Uncle Yusaku.	Jay, 2026-09-21 (73d7fb7); ...
btn@MITIM.take_out	line	Take	Jay, 2026-09-24 (decisions § 21 G8-MITIM: "it should just be 'Take'")
M27	phrase	specks of light	Jay, 2026-09-24 (decisions § 22: "specks of light" stays)
```

* **id** is a line id of the day files or `clips.txt`, a texture string id
  (`translation/textures/`), or a movie file (`M27`), held by any one of its cues. An id may have
  several rows, one per phrase.
* **match** is `line` when Jay chose the line's whole English (a button, a label, a menu row):
  it must be exactly the words. It is `phrase` when he chose part of a line: the words must
  appear in it, not as part of a longer word ("Take" is not held by "Takeout"), and the rest of
  the line may still be revised around them. The tanka's `phrase` is its " / ": Jay chose the
  slashes, not the words.
* **words** as the line's file writes them — pages joined by ` // `, options by ` | ` — held in
  every copy if a line is translated twice.
* **source** is whose, when and where it was recorded. English only, as the translation files.

What holds it: `tests/test_locked.py` fails when a line loses its words (so `./make.sh test`
catches a hand edit or a sweep), every packet part names the locked words of its lines under
"Words that stay", and `./make.sh save-event` refuses an answer that drops them. Changing a
lock is Jay's call: change the line and its row together, with his ruling as the source. Every
new ruling of his on a line's words gets a row in the same commit that applies it.

## movies.txt

The subtitles drawn over the movies (PLAN `FMV-02` writes them, `FMV-04` draws them). One
cue per row, tab-separated:

```
movie <TAB> first frame <TAB> last frame <TAB> English [<TAB> options]
M27	1105	1213	『The heat of that day was as if all the workings | of life on earth had become tangled and snarled,
M27	3034	3258	All the flowers that bloom across | this wide meadow,	panel
```

* **movie** is the file the movie plays — the `file` column of
  [research/data/movies.tsv](../research/data/movies.tsv): `M27` is the opening, `M28` the
  ending, `M60` the fireworks. A cue belongs to the file, not to a `MOVIE` id: the three
  ids that play `M27` all start at its frame 1, two of them stopping at frame 58, so a cue
  shows under whichever of them reaches its frames.
* **first frame, last frame** are the movie's own frame numbers, both shown: 1-based, 15 a
  second, so the frame at `m:ss.s` into the movie is `1 + 15 × seconds`, rounded. The
  decoded movies `./make.sh movies` writes to `work/movies/*.avi` play at the same 15 fps
  with the narration, which is what to time against. The player may change a cue a
  fifteenth of a second early (`research/movies.md` § 7) — no one can see it.
* **English** is drawn centred near the bottom of the picture (or the top: **options**),
  white with a dark outline, in the same proportional font as the dialogue, at most **two
  lines** of at most 318 pixels each. ` | ` breaks the line where you put it; without one the text is wrapped at
  the width. A literal `|` cannot be drawn.
* **options** are optional, space-separated. `caption` marks a cue that translates writing
  in the picture rather than speech (`M27`'s written thought, FMV-08): `movie-timing` holds
  it to the reading rate, the shortest time and overlap but to no speech, and `--write`
  never moves its frames; it takes no narration marks. `panel` draws a dark panel two
  lines tall behind the cue, for text over busy writing such as the theme song's staff
  credits (FMV-06, FMV-09). A position is `bottom` (the default, what an empty field means)
  or `top`, the same two rows mirrored to the top of the picture, for a picture with
  something under the bottom rows (no cue uses it now; `research/movies.md` § 11).
* The adult Boku's narration — the cues over transcript segments of kind `narration` — is
  marked as the dialogue marks narration (style guide § 9): one pair per sentence, `『` at
  the start of its first cue and `』` at the end of its last, none on the cues between.
  Other cues (the song, the father's line, captions) carry none. `movie-timing` checks it
  (`cue-marks`), and the marks are not counted toward a cue's reading rate.
* `#` lines and blank lines are notes. There is no Japanese in this file, as in the day
  files: the transcripts of the narration stay under `work/`.

`./make.sh movie-timing` checks each cue's timing against the reviewed transcripts of the
narration and the song (and `--write` fixes what moving its frames can fix); `./make.sh movie-review`
shows every cue on Beetle, with a video of it over the voice (`research/movies.md` § 10).
`./make.sh lint-translation` checks every row — a known movie, frames inside it (the last
frame any id playing the file shows), no two cues of one movie overlapping, no more than two
lines, no line wider than the band, every character in the font, known options —
measured in the font the build installs (so run `./make.sh build-days` once first; without
it the pixel rules are a warning that they were not measured). `./make.sh build-days` refuses a file the lint
would fail, naming the row, because every cue goes into every days build. Nothing is cut
to fit: a cue too long for two lines becomes two cues.

## clips.txt

Subtitles for the voice clips the game plays from its own code rather than from an event —
the table `BOKU_XA.XCH`, clips `XCH.00`–`XCH.47`
([research/data/voice-only.tsv](../research/data/voice-only.tsv) says what each one says):
the first night's narration going to sleep (`XCH.34`), the five epilogues (`XCH.41`–`.45`)
and the bug-sumo voices (`XCH.00`–`.40`, laid out 42 px narrower: bug sumo starts its pen
right of Boku's portrait — `boku.clip_subs.clip_box`). A day file's row, keyed by the clip:

```
XCH.34	Narrator	And so the first day of that summer vacation came to an end.
```

* **id** is `XCH.` and the clip's two-digit number. Every worded clip has a row; a row
  without English draws nothing.
* **speaker** is for the reader of the file; it is not drawn.
* **English** is drawn in the dialogue band while the clip plays, with no speaker label, in
  pages split by ` // ` wherever you put them; each page stays up for its share of the clip,
  shared by length, and the last until the clip ends. An epilogue is half a minute to fifty
  seconds of narration, so give it as many pages as it needs.
* **times**, after a third tab, are optional: one number per page, the second of the clip's
  audio at which that page gives way — to the next page, or the last to nothing.

  ```
  XCH.45	Narrator	Within some 15 years ... // a huge dam ... // Nothing is left ...	5.3 12.2 24.2
  ```

  A row with times is not shared by length. **Every epilogue has them**: its clip ends in
  seconds of silence, so pages shared by length run late, and its picture changes to the
  production card before the clip ends (`research/event-scripts.md` § The epilogue's clock).
  Time a page to the pause before its sentence in `work/voice/xch/xch4n-*.wav` (`./make.sh
  voice-only` decodes them; second 0 is the clip's first sample), and the last page to a
  little before the card.

`./make.sh lint-translation` checks every row — a clip the table has, every page inside the
band, times that fit the pages and rise, and, of a row with several pages or with times, no
page up for less than 1.5 s or asking more than 17 characters a second; an epilogue's page
still up when the production card comes is an error — and `./make.sh build-days` refuses a
file it would fail. The reader draws each epilogue page over the still it meets, with a
timeline of pages against pictures, from the same layout; `./make.sh epilogue-review` plays
all five on Beetle and compares.

## status.tsv

Where each unit of the translation stands — PLAN `TRN-04`'s ladder, and the one home of its
table. One row per unit the reader walks, tab-separated, after a header row:

```
unit <TAB> state <TAB> date <TAB> note
day01	reviewed	2026-09-23	the TRN-10 whole-game session, ...
```

* **unit** is a day file's name (`day01`–`day31`), `shared`, `arrays`, `clips`, `movies`, or a
  texture unit: `screens` (`ui.txt`, `signs.txt`, `buttons.txt`, `records.txt`), `diary`,
  `books` (`boku.reader.TEXTURE_UNITS`; a new texture file is a unit by its own name).
* **state** is one of `undrafted`, `drafted`, `reviewed` (an independent agent against the
  Japanese), `checked` (Jay has read it, his comments applied), `rendered` (the lint's pixel
  fit and the page mock-ups say it would display), `finalized` (Jay has seen it in the game,
  formatted and displayed correctly).
* **date** is when the unit reached that state, `YYYY-MM-DD`; **note** says how.

A test holds this file to the units the translation files make, both ways: a new day file or
texture file fails it until it is given a row, and a row for a unit nothing walks fails it too.
English and ids only.
