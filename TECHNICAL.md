# boku-ps1, for the contributor

How the English patch for the PlayStation original of *Boku no Natsuyasumi* (**SCPS-10088**)
is built, and how this repository is laid out. What the patch is, how to get it and why it
exists are [README.md](README.md); the open work is [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

## Status

* **This fork's human pilot.** Thirteen entries in E0171, E0184 and E0112 have human review;
  eleven use replacement English in `translation/days/day01.txt`. Coverage and text hashes
  are recorded separately in `translation/human-review.tsv`; `translation/status.tsv`
  retains the upstream review history. All 21 page/choice previews matched repository
  layout. All 19 dialogue pages and choice navigation passed Beetle checks, and the owner
  reported a successful DuckStation review on 2026-10-09. The remaining status below
  describes the inherited foundation, not whole-game human approval.

* **Text.** The game draws English left to right, proportionally, in its own glyph sheet, in a
  translucent three-line band under the scene, with speaker labels in the original's
  `Uncle「…」` form and choice menus as rows beside the game's own hand. Every event of the 31
  days, the day-independent events, and the menus, books and screens are translated and
  reviewed against the Japanese by a second agent; where each unit stands is
  [translation/status.tsv](translation/status.tsv). A line that outgrows its space is
  relocated, never cut.
* **Textures.** Every image that carries Japanese has a ruled path
  ([research/textures-plan.md](research/textures-plan.md)); the picture diary, the two
  encyclopedias, the title and menu plates, the buttons, the records, the signs, bug sumo's
  bout and the kite-flying HUD are set in English at build time from your import.
* **Movies and voices.** The narrated movies and the theme song are subtitled inside the video
  frames; the voice clips with no text on the disc — the five epilogues, the first night's
  narration, bug sumo, voice-only lines in events — are subtitled in the band. The voices
  themselves stay Japanese.
* **Where it is seen.** Each piece is confirmed on Beetle PSX (the core Mode One runs) wherever
  play can reach it, most on PCSX-Redux too, and Jay plays the builds on DuckStation.

## Principles

1. **The whole repo is public.** The fan-translation norm is to work in private and post a
   finished patch. Here the tools, the format notes, the translation and its history are all
   in the repo, and pull requests with better ideas, options or styles are welcome.
2. **The repo contains none of the original game.** No image, no extracted files, no Japanese
   script, no ripped textures. Everything taken from the disc is regenerated locally by the
   *import step* from a dump you own, into gitignored directories. Two deliberate exceptions.
   Textures **redrawn** in English are new images and are committed (Jay, 2026-09-20); whether
   a redraw of a copyrighted image carries the original's copyright is arguable, and the
   project takes that chance. Textures that merely get subtitles composited onto the original
   pixels are *not* committed — the repo holds the subtitle text and placement, and the build
   composites them onto your import. And the README shows a handful of screenshots of the
   patched game, the only pictures of it here (CLAUDE.md § "This repo is public").
3. **Translation is keyed by line id.** Committed translation files hold English plus context
   notes written for this project, keyed by stable ids; the Japanese for an id exists only in
   your local import. The human-review spreadsheet addresses those same ids. Its CSV is
   validated and staged locally before an approved candidate enters the day files; it
   never writes the repository directly. The read-only script reader remains available
   (`./make.sh reader`, PLAN `TRN-14`). There is no `.po`/Weblate layer.
4. **Quality over throughput.** Reverse engineering and translation run on the strongest
   available model even where that makes the project slower.
5. **Reproducible from a verified dump.** One command takes a Redump-verified image to a
   patched image with a known checksum; the released patch is that build's output.

The charter — who the translation is for and what kind it is — is README § "Who this is for".

## The translation pipeline

README § "How the translation is made" says who writes the English, what they are given and
who checks it. The mechanics: a translator's reading is assembled by `./make.sh packet` — the
bible, style guide and glossary whole, then the scenes one after another, a day's worth or
the whole game in play order (`translation/README.md`). The box limits are not handed to it:
the lint measures every page and `./make.sh mockup` draws them. Scenes are readable in order
outside the game, the Japanese beside the English, in a reader built for this project rather
than a generic localization platform (`./make.sh reader`).

The translation files remain the interface between the script and the build. This fork's
human pilot exercises that interface through `review-pilot` and `review-preview`, retaining
the renderer, page timing, choices and relocation. The spreadsheet ports the exact wrapping
rules using measured character advances; repository lint and mockups decide whether an
imported candidate fits. See `translation/README.md` for the round trip and its current scope.

## What gets translated

| | Content | Plan |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Text drawn by the game's own renderer — dialogue, menus, item and insect names | **The priority.** |
| 2 | Japanese text inside textures — the picture diary, the encyclopedias, menu plates and buttons, signs | After 1. Each image's path is in [research/textures-plan.md](research/textures-plan.md). The ones translated are **programmatic**: the Japanese is painted out of its panel and the English set in the game's own glyphs (or one of the project's two small pixel faces where the space is too small), at build time from your import, so only the English is committed ([translation/textures/](translation/textures/README.md)). The rest stay Japanese by the charter or by Jay's ruling — a shop sign is a shop sign; the book covers convey the game's style. |
| 3 | Narration and songs inside the movies (`__STR/*.IKI`: the opening `M27`, the one ending movie `M28`, and three more) | In scope since 2026-09-20 — Jay, after playing: the opening "definitely needs subtitles". The player draws 24-bit frames straight into VRAM, so the subtitles are composited into each frame by a hook in the player (`asm/movie.asm`, ruled 2026-09-22 over burning them in — [research/movies.md](research/movies.md)), keyed by movie and frame from `translation/movies.txt`. |
| 4 | Voices (`__STR/BOKU_XA.XAM`) | **Kept Japanese on purpose** — subtitles, not a dub (README § "Who this is for"). |
| 5 | Voice-overs with no text — the five endings (a still with narration over it, after the one ending movie) and voice-only clips in play, such as the narrator at the well | In scope since 2026-09-22 (Jay, from playing): subtitled in the dialogue band while the clip plays ([research/voice-only.md](research/voice-only.md); the English is in the day files and `translation/clips.txt`). An epilogue's pages are timed to its narration and are gone before its production card ([research/event-scripts.md](research/event-scripts.md) § The epilogue's clock). |

## The central risk was vertical text

The original draws all its dialogue top to bottom in a narrow strip down the right of the
screen (Jay, from playing it), and a 512 KB MIPS executable decides that. The fallbacks were,
cheapest first: bend the renderer to advance horizontally with a per-glyph width table; the
same with a replacement glyph sheet; or leave it alone and draw a subtitle overlay on top. The
first held. The text stepper already had a horizontal mode, direction is an *argument* (the
dialogue is vertical because two call sites pass a literal 1), and the 12×12 font sheet already
has A–Z, a–z and the digits; the punctuation it lacks is drawn for this project. The renderer
patches (`asm/`, armips) draw each text surface proportionally — one hook per surface, as every
comparable project needed — and the dialogue panel became the band under the scene. The detail
is [research/text-renderer.md](research/text-renderer.md) and
[research/vwf-prototype.md](research/vwf-prototype.md). The PS2 sequel's English patch and the
PSP port's Spanish patch converted vertical text the same way in their versions of this engine
([research/renderer-prior-art.md](research/renderer-prior-art.md)).

## What the disc looks like

One Mode 2 data track: a PS-X EXE (`SCPS_100.88`), one 104 MiB headerless archive
(`BOKU.BIN`, whose directory is three arrays inside the executable), XA voice audio and STR video. Game text is
**not Shift-JIS**: it is 16-bit indices into the font sheet with `0x8000`-range control codes —
the same scheme, and at least largely the same glyph order, as the PSP port and the PS2 sequel.
Details, measurements and what is still unknown: [research/disc-recon.md](research/disc-recon.md)
and [research/boku-bin.md](research/boku-bin.md) (the archive's 1,302 members, mapped).

## How the build works

Import → extract to line ids → the committed translation files → the build → a patched image →
a patch. The build lays each line out in its box's pixels, rebuilds every copy of it and every
container around it, relocates a member that outgrows its sectors, typesets the textures,
assembles the renderer and movie hooks, and regenerates each touched sector's EDC/ECC. The
standing gate is the null round trip: every text site reinserted unchanged through the full
rebuild reproduces the original image byte for byte. How the containers grow is
[research/relocation.md](research/relocation.md).

## Using it

Every recurring command is a verb of `./make.sh`. **`./make.sh help` is the full list**, with
what each verb does and where its switches are; most take `--help`. It needs `uv` (which
installs Python and the Python tools on first use) and, for a CHD, `chdman` (MAME's —
`brew install rom-tools`). `build-days` needs armips; the emulator verbs — and `saves` and
`duckstation-cards`, which boot a new game on Beetle once to start from — need PCSX-Redux or
the Beetle PSX core and a retail BIOS. They are found in `~/Dev/retro-trainer/config/` without
any setup; anywhere else, set `BOKU_LIBRETRO_CORE` and `BOKU_LIBRETRO_SYSTEM` —
[research/tooling-setup.md](research/tooling-setup.md) § "Where the emulator verbs find the core
and the BIOS". `./make.sh help` names what the other verbs need.

### The import step

It comes first, once:

```
./make.sh import path/to/your-dump.chd      # or .cue / .bin / .img, or set BOKU_DISC
./make.sh extract                           # the decoded script, into disc/script/
```

`import` verifies the image against the Redump checksum (recorded in
[research/disc-recon.md](research/disc-recon.md) § "The dump") and refuses anything else, then
writes `disc/image.img`, `disc/image.cue`, `disc/manifest.json` and the extracted files under
`disc/files/`; `extract` writes the script as line ids and per-scene flow graphs. Everything
that reads the game needs them, and nothing they write is ever committed.

### The verbs, by task

| to | run |
|---|---|
| build the game in English and play it | `./make.sh build-days`, then load `build/days/days-<stamp>-<hash>.cue` — named by the revision, so a play report can say what it tested |
| start from any day | `./make.sh duckstation-cards`: memory cards that start any morning from August 2 to 31, August 31 with the stars for each of the five endings, a finished game (Summer Memories), and bug-sumo saves ([research/sumo.md](research/sumo.md)); `INDEX.tsv` beside them lists every slot, and [research/save-format.md](research/save-format.md) § "Playing a generated save in DuckStation" says how to put one in slot 1 without touching your own card. `saves` writes the same saves a card each for the headless tools, `save` one card from parameters |
| read the translation | `./make.sh reader` → `work/reader/index.html`: the whole translation in play order, the Japanese beside the English, each id one key to copy, the lint's findings on their lines. `build-days` rewrites it, and its header says which build it was read against |
| check the translation | `./make.sh lint-translation` (ids, choice menus, page counts, fit in pixels, movie cues); `./make.sh mockup` (every page drawn at the band's geometry, no emulator); `./make.sh coverage` (per day, what the build did with every line); `./make.sh textures check` (the texture strings typeset, and what each refused) |
| translate | `./make.sh packet` and `./make.sh save-event` — the workflow is [translation/README.md](translation/README.md) |
| review in a spreadsheet | `./make.sh review-pilot export` for complete events; `./make.sh review-preview BUNDLE --csv FILE` to remeasure returned edits; `./make.sh review-pilot import` stages a candidate under ignored `work/`. See [translation/README.md](translation/README.md), "Local human review pilot", for arguments and approval status. |
| time and see the movie subtitles | `./make.sh movies` (decode to `work/movies/`), `./make.sh movie-timing` (each cue against the transcripts), `./make.sh movie-review` (each cue on Beetle, with the narration) |
| time and see the epilogues' subtitles | the times on their rows of `translation/clips.txt` ([translation/README.md](translation/README.md) § clips.txt); `./make.sh reader` draws each page over the still it meets, with a timeline of pages against pictures; `./make.sh epilogue-review` plays all five on Beetle and compares |
| drive an emulator | `./make.sh smoke` (boot on both headless emulators), `boot-save`, `examine`, `sumo-bout` (Beetle from a generated save) |
| retake the README's screenshots | `./make.sh screenshots` (the built image on Beetle → `docs/screenshots/`) |
| test | `./make.sh test`, `./make.sh lint`; `./make.sh emu-test` for the tests that boot an emulator |
| make a patch | `./make.sh patch --modified build/days/image.img` (PPF + xdelta + both sides' hashes into `build/patch/`); `./make.sh apply-patch DUMP PATCH --out FILE` applies one, checking both hashes. |
| cut a release | tag `v<version>` and push it, then `./make.sh release` (the xdelta download and the optional PPF one, each a zip, into `release/v<version>/`; `--no-ppf` for none; beside them the patched disc, and in `release/v0/` the dump, each as image, `.cue` and `.chd` to check by hand), `./make.sh release-row release/v<version>` (its row in README § "Which version do I have?"; commit and push README.md) and `./make.sh publish-release release/v<version> --yes` |
| play on Mode One | `./make.sh export-to-mode-one` (packs `build/days` as Mode One's `boku.chd` and pins its SHA-1; then rebuild Mode One) |

## Delivery

For this fork, the first proposed tag is `v0.0.1-testpilot.1`, marked as a GitHub prerelease.
Cut it from a clean commit containing the approved English and tooling, use `release --no-ppf`,
and inspect the xdelta zip before publication. The optional PPF carries relocated original
bytes and is excluded from this pilot's public assets. Images, BIOS, extracted Japanese,
local review context and mockup pixels stay ignored. The published notes must state the
13-entry human-review scope, known wording flags and verification results. Keep the release
table derived from the packaged manifest; never substitute a local test image's hash for
the clean release build's hash.

Maintain this fork's tested work on `master`, with reviewed batches on working branches.
Fetch upstream periodically and merge selected updates through an integration branch,
checking conflicts, layout and the relevant emulator route before merging into the fork.
Preserve published tags; publish changed release content under a new version. The upstream
delivery mechanics follow.

* **Public release:** a patch against the Redump-verified image, via GitHub Releases, with the
  base and result checksums stated. Never an image. Tag the commit `v<version>`, push the
  tag, then `./make.sh release` (writes `release/v<version>/`), `./make.sh release-row
  release/v<version>` (adds the version to README § "Which version do I have?"; commit and
  push README.md) and `./make.sh publish-release release/v<version> --yes`. The PPF is a
  separate, optional download. The release page quotes README § "Where it is played", §
  "How the translation is made" and § "Related work and credit" whole; what a release holds
  and checks, and how to withdraw the PPF, is `boku/release.py`'s docstring.
* **Mode One** (`~/Dev/retro-trainer/one`), the phone frontend Jay plays on: it does not apply
  the patch. `./make.sh export-to-mode-one` packs the built image as its `one/roms/boku.chd`
  and pins that file's SHA-1 in its index (`boku/mode_one.py` says how). It runs PS1 on Beetle
  PSX, so the build must be confirmed on that core.

## Reference material

Kept locally under `reference/`, not redistributed here:

* **jooey's FAQ/Walkthrough**, v0.36 (2002-11-24) — an English account of the game's events,
  used as story context for translation. It is on GameFAQs under the PlayStation game
  "Boku no Natsuyasumi" (<https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com>, search the title); save the text
  version as `reference/gamefaqs-guide.txt`.
* **Action Button's review of the game** (Tim Rogers, six hours, English) —
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779coR-XPTw>. Its auto-generated transcript is long-form
  context on the story, characters and feel; fetch it with `yt-dlp` to
  `reference/youtube-779coR-XPTw-transcript.txt`.
* **xneo.jp's Japanese walkthrough** — <https://xneo.jp/bokunatsu/> → `reference/xneo/`.
  Day-by-day events in the game's own vocabulary.

How PS1 translation is done in general — tools, patch formats, case studies, release norms —
is surveyed in [research/ps1-translation-practice.md](research/ps1-translation-practice.md);
the projects this one learned from are credited in README § "Related work and credit".

## Contributing

You need your own dump of the game. After the import step you have everything the project has.
Translation changes are edits to the id-keyed files; say in the PR what you were looking at in
the game. Disagreements about style are welcome — the translation's style guide is
[translation/style-guide.md](translation/style-guide.md), and it can be argued with like any
other file.
