  research-tsv                  regenerate the script walk's five research/data tables from
                                your import; a test diffs them against the tracked copies,
                                which is the gate on the walk. The other generated tables
                                there have their own verbs -- texture-census, texture-plan,
                                movies, voice-only -- and glyph-table.tsv is kept by hand (research/font.md)

  voice-only [arguments]        regenerate research/data/voice-only.tsv -- one row per XA

                                census, so it needs no disc
  trial [arguments]             build the TXT-04 trial image into build/trial/

                                translation into build/image/, rebuilding every
                                container a grown line moves
                                (./make.sh build --help for the switches)
  build-days [arguments]        the whole thing: assemble the TXT-05 renderer into
                                build/vwf/edits.json, then build the translation
                                (translation/days/) and the English textures

                                and members relocated where a line outgrew its
                                sectors; then the reader (work/reader/) against it.

                                per scene under work/mockup/ -- no emulator; needs

                                encodable characters, pixel fit, array byte sizes, and
                                the additive-word heuristic; and translation/movies.txt,

                                the build did with it -- translated, refused (English
                                exists, the image did not get it), missing (never given to
                                a translator) or not-event (a menu, book or title-screen

  save --base B --out CARD [..] write one memory-card save from parameters: the morning it

  boot-save CARD [arguments]    boot CARD's slot-1 save on Beetle to the morning it wakes
                                on; shoot it, save a state to resume from, and check the

  sumo-bout CARD [arguments]    boot CARD on Beetle and play it into a bug-sumo bout with the
                                first bug of its cage; check the fighter the game builds;
                                --mantis fights the mantis and follows E1754 to the shortcut

  movie-timing [--write]        every movie cue's timing against the reviewed transcripts

  screenshots [arguments]       the README's screenshots, one screen of each kind the patch

  epilogue-review [N...]        the five epilogues on Beetle from build/days: when each

                                -- and report each one's result; missing prerequisites
                                (emulator, core, BIOS) fail loudly rather than
                                being skipped (research/tooling-setup.md)

Everything runs through uv, which installs Python and the dev tools on first use. The
verbs that boot an emulator find Beetle PSX's core, its BIOS directory and PCSX-Redux's
BIOS in ~/Dev/retro-trainer/config/ (or $BOKU_MODE_ONE's) unless BOKU_LIBRETRO_CORE,
BOKU_LIBRETRO_SYSTEM or REDUX_BIOS says otherwise (tools/libretro/emulator_paths.py).
